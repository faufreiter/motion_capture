- Important graphs of the paper can be found in the notebook "data_collection.ipynb"


### ABSTRACT
This paper and the experiment carried out deal with the research question:

How does the natural use of dumbbells, especially in relation to the form and technique during biceps curls, vary among individuals?
A group of 7 participants with different previous experiences and fitness levels were observed. Data on these areas was collected beforehand using a questionnaire.

During the practical phase, participants did 12 bicep curls with each arm using a 5kg dumbbell without prior technique instructions. The exercises were recorded with a Qualisys motion capture system, using 3 markers on each arm and 2 markers on the dumbbell.

The data shows that there are differences between the participants in various categories such as duration of execution, range of motion and previous weight training experience. Potential improvements are also identified.
